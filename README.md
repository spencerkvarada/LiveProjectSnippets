# LiveProjectSnippets
These are small portions of the tasks I worked on throughout the two week live project.

On top of these tasks, before the second week of the project, I was assigned to be SCRUM leader. As we had built this project from the ground up, I had a hand in all the core and foundational points of the application.

One of my tasks was to integrate fullcalendar into the website, as well as use it as a medium for event handling. I had to research and produce an interactive calendar that could pass events back to the database as well as controller functions to read that data back to the calendar. There were many matriculating tasks that came from this, such as creating roles and adjusting permissions, integrating a Date/Time selector, managing data display on multiple views, and database integrity protection.

There were many portions of this project that required skills I wasn't familiar with prior to the project, but was able to quickly adapt to and integrate. An example of this is the JSON functions found in the database functionality folder above. I gained great confidence in my ability to learn quickly and adapt to an uncertain environment.
